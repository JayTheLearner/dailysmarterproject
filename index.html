      <h1>Welcome to The Daily Smarter Project!</h1>
      <h2>As you can see, there isn't much to this, yet. But there will be.</h2>
      <h2>The goal here is that if you learn something every day, even if it's just a little,</h2>
      <h2>over the long run, you can accomplish a lot.</h2>
      <p>Right now, this website isn't very good. But that's okay! It's my first website. Your first
        anything isn't going to be very good. But you plug away at it, and you slowly get better at it
        and your work starts to get better. A short time ago, this website didn't exist. And now because
        I made something, anyone across the globe can see it and watch my videos. And that's really cool.

      <h3>First Struggle Video</h3>
      <p>I'm going to do stuggle videos from time to time. It's a good way to vent, and also
        I hope that other people can watch it and feel comfort that they aren't the only ones
        who struggle with this stuff.
